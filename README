Provides a way to split a views table row into two.
In the table style settings, select a "Secondary row" option.

So if a table looks like this:
Name | Description | Edit link | Delete link
selecting "Name" as the secondary row option for "Edit link" and "Description"
as the secondary row option for the "Delete link" will render two rows:

Name        | Description
MyNode      | Sample description
node/1/edit | node/1/delete

As you can see, columns selected to render in the "secondary row" aren't
rendered in the table header.
